# Requirements

## End-user observation

Name: Stephen M. Compton, Artist, New Yorker
Needs: A way to cook his leftover ingredients to reduce waste, help the environment, and save money
Alternative solution: Perform a Google search for each unused ingredient
Pain points: Time-consuming to do multiple Google searches
How we solve their issues: Our application should save Stephen’s time by aggregating all the recipes that use Stephen’s ingredients into one page.
